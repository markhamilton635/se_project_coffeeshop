# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Continueing to work on this webpage i would like to include more personalized background images, something to stand out for the coffee shop. i would also like to make all the images used relative to the window size so they dont squish together when the window size gets smaller. i would like to add some more flare to the recipes section as well, so it feels welcoming and creative.
